# Climate API
A powerful engine for weather presets and visual effects

Use the regional climate to set up different effects for different regions.
Control where your effects are activated based on temperature, humidity, wind,
position, light level or a completely custom activator.
Climate API provides temperature and humidity values on a block-per-block basis
that follow the seasons, day / night cycle and random changes.
Make it rain, change the sky or poison the player - it's up to you.
