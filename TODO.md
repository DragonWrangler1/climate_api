# TODO

## Required for MVP
- Fix obvious bugs that prevent weathers from being selected
- Test if day progression works
- Test non-random heat and humidity values
- Fix noise function
- Implement sounds
- Test if sky changes are working
- Implement start/end events
- Make sure all weather presets are working
- Implement chat commands

## Planned for first release
- Improve test_condition function
- Implement ABM system for additional effects
- Add light level to possible conditions
- Implement fallback for sky changes without skylayer
- Configurable number of days in a year
- Add license information to source files
- Write helpful README
- Find good values for weather conditions
- Make switches between effects more smooth

## Nice to have
- Write documentation on how to add weathers and effects
- Register *Moon Phases* as a weather preset using the *skybox* effect
- Assign meta data (like "downfall", "wind", etc.) to weather presets
- Fog effects

## Future Plans & Ideas
- Complete season system
	- crops grow better in their respective season or worse in winter
	- regrowing apples, lemons, etc. in their respective months
	- holidays and reminders via chat commands
	- day/night nycle adjusted to season
	- special events like a bloodmoon -> increased mob spawns
- Fantasy weather effects
	- pretty skyboxes
	- swirling flower petals, mushroom spores, etc. in fitting biomes
	- underground environment effects
	- space effects at high y-level (meteors, magnetic storms, different skybox)
- Eco Pack (with climate change)
	- Integration with Technic mods, etc.
	- Track planted trees vs chopped wood, killed mobs, etc.
	- Ecological footprint influences weather
	- Extreme weather scenarios and desasters
	- Tornados, poisonous rain that kills crops and animals, bush fires,...
- Survival Pack
	- Body temperature becomes survival aspect
	- Use local heat as base value
	- swimming will cool down
	- standing near fire will warm up
	- craftable warm clothes
	- metal armor will worsen heat issues
